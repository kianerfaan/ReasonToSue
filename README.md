This is a full-stack web application built with React (frontend) and Express (backend). Here's how it works:

Frontend (client/):

Entry point is main.tsx which renders the React app
Uses React Router (via wouter) for navigation between pages:
Home page (/)
Analysis page (/analysis/:id)
Uses TanStack Query for data fetching
Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
Components are organized in components/ directory
Backend (server/):

Express server (server/index.ts) running on port 5000
Handles API routes in routes.ts:
POST /api/analyze - Analyzes legal cases using Groq AI API
GET /api/cases/:id - Retrieves case details
Uses PostgreSQL database (via Drizzle ORM) for storage
Schema defined in shared/schema.ts for both frontend and backend
The app appears to be a legal analysis tool that:

Takes case details from users
Uses AI to analyze the legal implications
Stores results in a database
Allows users to view previously analyzed cases
The server logs API requests and handles both development (with Vite) and production builds. The frontend is built with a component library using Radix UI primitives for accessibility.

There's currently a DOM nesting warning in the frontend where an <a> tag is incorrectly nested within another <a> tag, which should be fixed for better accessibility.
